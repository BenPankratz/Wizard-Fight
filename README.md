For the final project in the class, we made a "Harry Potter" themed game using Swing. First the user answers a quiz and then they will be assigned to a house. Depending on the house, the user's stats will be boosted in different ways. Afterwards, the user can fight against npc wizards in a Pokemon styled battle. There is also a shop that sells stat boosting items.
Hope you enjoy!
